# Wisonsin-breast-cancer-data-analysis
Breast cancer being one of the major cause of death among women, if tumor is not detected in early stages sometimes it is difficult to detect the tumor therefore, I am trying to implement machine learning algorithm to detect breast cancer for the well being of mankind.

# INTRODUCTION
Machine learning is a method of data analysis that provide machines i.e. computers the ability to build analytical model.
So basically it is a branch of AI which is based on idea that systems can learn from he available data, identify patterns and also make decision with very less human help.
Machine learning incorporates a large set of statistical techniques.
With the help of these techniques we can create models with old data and detect patterns from noisy and massive data set.
We have used various statistical learning methods for cancer prediction and prognosis.
The objective is to present a report on breast cancer where we took advantage of those available technological advancements to develop prediction models for breast cancer survivability.
